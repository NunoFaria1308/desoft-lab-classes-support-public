# Mutation Testing for TypeScript

The installation steps are not required for this project. You can skip to the Run Stryker section.

# Configuring Mutation testing with Stryker

Either install stryker globally

```shell
$ npm install -g stryker-cli
```

or locally:

```shell
$ npm install --save-dev @stryker-mutator/core
$ npm install --save-dev @stryker-mutator/jest-runner
$ npm install --save-dev @stryker-mutator/typescript-checker
```

## Configure Stryker

If you want to configure Stryker, run the following command:

```shell
$ stryker init
```

Otherwise, look at the configuration file already provided on this project stryker.conf.json

## Git Ignore Stryker folder

Stryker also changes the .gitignore file to ignore the stryker folder: .stryker-tmp

## Run Stryker Mutation when globally installed 

```shell
$ stryker run
```

## Run Stryker when locally installed 

```shell
$ npx stryker run
```
